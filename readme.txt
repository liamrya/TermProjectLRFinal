Project Name: Super Mario Bros! v.112
A side-scroller game similar to Super Mario Bros! Mario is able to move left, right,
and jump. Obstacles such as goombas, hammer bros, bricks, and gaps attempt to stop 
him from reaching the end of the level. Hammer bros throw hammers at Mario and cannot be
killed unless in star mode. Goombas die if Mario lands on their head. He can collect 
powerups along the way such as a mushroom that makes him taller, and a star that makes 
him essentially invincibile. Have fun!

How to run the project: Simply download and open TermProjectLRFinal and run main.py

Arrow keys to move left, right, and up
